# automatic-feeder
Another school project - Automatic feeder for small pets. Programmed with Arduino Uno.

There were three buttons:
- first for immediate feed
- second for adjusting first time of feeding during the day
- third for djusting second time of feeding during the day


And on the 16x2 LCD display there were those two adjusted hours for feeding.
I also wanted to make this usable via GSM (SIM800L) but cause of my poor powering I failed.
